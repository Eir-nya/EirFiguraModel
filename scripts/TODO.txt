- fix sleep camera, first and third person
- fix hair while sleeping
- fix animations stuck on death (namely blocking)
- fix rapid blinking (reproducible with paradise lost mod by wearing a cloud hare on head and emoting)
	- can't reproduce in singleplayer
- check collision just below player when starting fall animation, cancel if close
- try and reduce lag when playing, might be exclusive to first person?
- use pain expression while blocking
- wave emote?
- cry emote?
- add funny cartoon squeak sfx when taking fall damage and when dying
