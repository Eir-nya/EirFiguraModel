TODO:
- action wheel: Third person sleep camera bullshit
- meow keybind
- make back of shirt a bit more apparent (big hair?)
- emotes continue until stopped if started with a right click
- disable dynamic eye stuff while sitting
- raycasting for sleeping and sitting
- elytra positioning when sleeping
- angel wings elytra + events for elytra flying
- angry eyes when blocking
- distinction between "swords" (incl. axes) and other "weapons" (bows, shields)
- "better first person"
	- make duplicate arm models just for first person view; hide main model's in first person, show those instead
- dynamic and glowing eyes should only appear from "RENDER" context, all other ones should use the original textured eyes
- make nonbinary stockings 3d
- fix arms going down when using swipeR animation while holding two items
- armor and boots replacements
	- leather armor
		- leather helmet: fluffy hood
			- on equip...
				* hide "head.3dhair.[west/east/south/up]", but enable "head.3dhair.north"
				* hide (and disable motion for) BACK "head.hair" wavey parts. the front ones should simply be limited so they dont clip outside the hood (TODO)
				* move bow forward
				* replace ears with ear armor
		- leather chestplate: fluffy jacket
			- on equip...
				* disable "body.body layer down"
				* disable "body.3dshirt"
				* disable "[right/left]arm.FurUp"
		- leather leggings: fluffy shorts
			- on equip...
				* enable "body.armorbottom.FluffyLeggings"
				* enable "[right/left]leg.armor.FluffyLeggings"
				* disable "body.body", enable "body.body2"
				* disable "[right/left].[right/left] leg", enable "[right/left]leg.[right/left] leg2"

- make elytra follow body properly when animations are playing
- fix sleep camera, first and third person

NOTES:
to make ANY part parented to ANYTHING, ANYWHERE, point in a GLOBAL rotation:
- your custom rotation...
	- minus parent's rot
	- minus parent's anim rot
	- minus model base's origin rot
	- minus vanilla model's transform origin rot (?)
plan for head sway script:
- put group transforms with nothing parented to them that mimic the 3 directions (+x +y +z), so bottom left, bottom right, top left, behind bottom left, of the face and other body parts later if applicable
- separate tick process that calculates shit based on the current world space location of each, does subtraction and stuff
- find a way to figure out if a point is above or below a certain plane ie. the plane that would be if the bottom of the head extended forever
	- get "up" vector relative to part ("top left" part minus "bottom left" part)
- use all this shit just for "limiting" rotation; the rest is just simple code
- different parts can have different "frictions" (just makes velocity add less at a time) and different gravities
- (important) chains will not update if not visible
- the amount of gravity to add is NOT just (0, -0.2, 0), it's (((angle that would make part point straight down) - lastRotAngle) normalized * 0.2)
- subtract last rotation from the above to get the amount to add to velocity
- how am I going to add quick head motion/wind swaying/player movement swaying to velocity?
- "friction" needs to increase a significant amount based on what segment in the chain we're on

- idea: do a test tmrw by getting the "position matrix" of the head part and "applying" it to random model parts positioned above or below?
